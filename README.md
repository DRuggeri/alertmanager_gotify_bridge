# Alertmanager to Gotify webhook bridge

An [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/)-aware webhook endpoint that converts messages to [Gotify](https://gotify.net/) API calls.

Typically, this should have been created as a [Gotify Plugin](https://gotify.net/docs/plugin)... but after much trial and error, the plugin system never could build properly. I also prefer the idea of separating the translation layer from needing to be built on the *exact* version of the running Gotify server.

## Installation

### Binaries

Download the already existing [binaries](https://github.com/DRuggeri/alertmanager_gotify_bridge/releases) for your platform:

```bash
$ ./alertmanager_gotify_bridge <flags>
```

### From source

Using the standard `go install` (you must have [Go](https://golang.org/) already installed in your local machine):

```bash
$ go install github.com/DRuggeri/alertmanager_gotify_bridge
$ alertmanager_gotify_bridge <flags>
```

## Usage
NOTE: All parameters may be set as environment entries as well as provided on the command line. The environment entry is the same as the flag but converted to all capital letters.

For example, the environment entry for `gotify_token` may be set as `GOTIFY_TOKEN`

### Flags

```

### Templating
The bridge now supports [Go templating](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/), so you can customize the alert messages further with templates in the title and message annotations, that you can configure in the Grafana alertmanager section.  
For example add following line to the title:  
`{{if eq .Status "firing"}}ðŸ”¥{{else}}âœ…{{end}}`  
This differentiates firing from resolving alerts.  
  
Also, there are two methods you can use for additional customisation:
```
.Values                 Access alert-values, -labels and -metrics. 
                        Returns list of:
                            Metric  string
                            Labels  map[string]string
                            Value   float64
              
.Humanize <float64>     Rounds float and stripps trailing zeros to return more readable float.
                        .Humanize 5.3234134 returns 5.32
                        .Humanize 5.0       returns 5
```
To give further information and examples for use-cases for these methods:
Imagine a simple uptime-metric for multiple instances or jobs. If you configure an alert, it would fire if any instance or alert is down. The message would probably say something like "an instance or job is down".
But from the message you would not know which of the jobs or instances is the down one, or if there are multiple. To address this you have to use the `.Values` method. A alert-description could look like this:
```
{{if eq .Status "firing"}}
Following Providers are down: 
{{range $i, $provider := .Values}}
{{$provider.Labels.job}}, 
{{end}}
{{else}}
All providers are back up
{{end}}
```
Now if the alert fires it would list the jobs that are down. Which information the `.Values` method contains can be inspected in the Grafana alertmanager when configuring an alert and clicking the `Preview Alert` button.

## Metrics
The bridge tracks telemetry data for metrics within the server as well as exposes gotify's health (obtained via the /health endpoint) as prometheus metrics. Therefore, the bridge can be scraped with Prometheus on /metrics to obtain these metrics.

Exported metrics:
- alertmanager_gotify_bridge_requests_received: Number of HTTP requests received regardless of being wel-formed
- alertmanager_gotify_bridge_requests_invalid: Number of HTTP requests received that were apparently invalid HTTP requests
- alertmanager_gotify_bridge_alerts_received: Overall number of alerts that were received, regardless of being well-formed
- alertmanager_gotify_bridge_alerts_invalid: Number of alerts that were missing required fields and could not be dispatched to gotify
- alertmanager_gotify_bridge_alerts_processed: Number of alerts that were succesfully translated and dispatched to gotify
- alertmanager_gotify_bridge_alerts_failed: Number of alerts that could not be sent to gotify after decoding
- alertmanager_gotify_bridge_gotify_up: Simple up/down for whether the /health endpoint could be probed by the bridge
- alertmanager_gotify_bridge_gotify_health_health: Whether the /health endpoint returns "green" for "health"
- alertmanager_gotify_bridge_gotify_health_database: Whether the /health endpoint returns "green" for "database"

## Community Contributions
* A docker container of this bridge is also maintained by [ndragon798](https://github.com/ndragon798) on [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/nathaneaston/alertmanager_gotify_bridge-docker)

## Testing and Development
If you would like to experiment and test your bridge configuration, you can simulate Prometheus alerts like so

Start the bridge with your choice of parameters. For example: set a bogus token, enable debug, and listen on port 8080 while accepting all other defaults:
`
GOTIFY_TOKEN=FOO ./alertmanager_gotify_bridge --port=8080 --debug
`

You can then send a request with cURL to see if your configuration works out as expected:
```
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/gotify_webhook -d '
{ "alerts": [
  {
    "annotations": {
      "description":"A description",
      "summary":"A summary",
      "priority":"critical"
    },
    "status": "firing",
    "generatorURL": "http://foobar.com"
  }
]}
'
```
