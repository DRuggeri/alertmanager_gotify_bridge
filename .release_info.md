## New
 - As of this release, a scratch-based container will now be available in the Docker hub! See README for coordinates - thanks @ngosang, @mad73923 for #14!

## Fixed/Breaking
 - The documentation and code for the summary/content annotation were reversed. This is now fixed, but may lead to reversed messages if you got used to the incorrect behavior. Thanks @ngosang for reporting in #14!
 - Documentation now includes the environment variables to set for overrides
