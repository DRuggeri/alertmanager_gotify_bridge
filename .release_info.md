## New
- Add support for overriding the token per-request and enable use of all [prometheus template functions](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/template_reference/) - thanks, @IncognitoCoding for PR #26!

## Misc
- Going forward, the official docker images should now contain CA anchors to avoid unknown authority errors when Gotify is running on HTTPS - thanks for the report in #25, @evandeaubl!
